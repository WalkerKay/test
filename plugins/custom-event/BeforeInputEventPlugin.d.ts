 * Create an `onBeforeInput` event to match
 * http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/WD-DOM-Level-3-Events-20131105/#events-inputevents.
 *
 * This event plugin is based on the native `textInput` event
 * available in Chrome, Safari, Opera, and IE. This event fires after
 * `onKeyPress` and `onCompositionEnd`, but before `onInput`.
 *
 * `beforeInput` is spec'd but not implemented in any browsers, and
 * the `input` event does not provide any useful information about what has
 * actually been added, contrary to the spec. Thus, `textInput` is the best
 * available event to identify the characters that have actually been inserted
 * into the target node.
 *
 * This plugin is also responsible for emitting `composition` events, thus
 * allowing us to share composition fallback code for both `beforeInput` and
 * `composition` event types.
